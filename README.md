# React Hooks

- they are normal js Function- written by fb developer
- i install in react right.In a node_modules,i got all the utility function into a code
- there are 2 most important hooks

  - 90 % of use this hooks
  - useState() =>Superpowerful State Variables in react
  - useEffect() =>If there is no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render
    => If dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on Initial render (Just Once)
    => If dependency array is [btnName] => called everytime btnName is updated

- I use shimmer UI => while loadng it shows fake cards

- Here i use createBrowserRouter for further details click on below link and read it out then you get a clear view
